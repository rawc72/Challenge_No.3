# Password Generator Starter Code:
The purpose of this Challenge is to create a random password generator tool based on a user-selected criteria.

## User Story:
As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria which include alphanumeric and special characters, so that the generated password is strong and provides greater security.

To make the use of the tool more intuitive for the user, I am including a second button called "Select Criteria". The "Generate Password" button will be disabled until the user clicks on the "Select Criteria" button and selects the complexity of the password in terms of length, use of alphanumeric and special characters.

## Acceptance Criteria:
When I press the Select Criteria button, I will be prompted to select the criteria of the password. These criteria include:
1) Length of the password between >=8 to <=128 characters,
2) Use of lowercase letters,
3) Use of uppercase letters,
4) Use of numeric characters,
5) Use of special characters.
Once the user has selected the characters, the Generate Password button will be activated, and the user will have the option to click that button and have a complex password generated.

## Use of a second button:
I felt that it would be more intuitive for the user when using the tool to have two buttons. The first button is called "Select Criteria". When clicked-on, this button will display a window with options for the user to select the criteria they wish to add to the password. If the user has not selected criteria, the Generate Password button will remain disabled. The user must select the length of the password, and at least one other criteria for the password generator to produce a password.

Once the length and at least one other criteria are selected, the Generate Password button will be activated and the password will be produced when click-on. The password will contain the criteria which was selected by the user and will omit any criteria the user did not select when prompted to do so after clicking the Select Criteria button.
